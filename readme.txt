Ever reminisce about those good old high school days? Weren’t they some of the worst you’ve ever experienced? 
Well after you’ve played this game, you can at least tell yourself that you didn’t have it as bad as the 4 misfit characters did.

Relive the nightmare experience, albeit in top-down RPG form. God knows the real thing isn’t an experience to be repeated.

You will need the RPG Maker VX editor to open the source files, but the game is also available here in a neat little ZIP:

**Regarding Glitches**
I think I already dealt with most
of the glitches, but if an error occurs,
the error is logged on a text document
called Backtrace.txt, which is created 
inside the game folder. Please send this
document to me if anything happens.

In any case, any questions, comments, or complaints
should be directed to my email at
